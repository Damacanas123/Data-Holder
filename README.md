# Data-Holder
In this project I implemented Feige-Fiat-Shamir zero knowledge protocol in order to block unwanted data retrievals from the service.

The motivation for this project is to keep our family confidential data in a server in a secure way. 

The mobile application that utilizes this backend service uses its private keys to "unlock" the service and retrieve our confidential data.

Encrypted data is stored in service for extra security.
